    2. the function name. for constructor functions, the name of the function should be capitalized
    3. the perameters. these will be the values for the keys in our object once a new 'Person' is created
    4. the 'this' keyword refers back to whatever called it, or whatever activates it. in this case, '.this' refers back to 'Person'.
    5. the keys of the new object were creating. 
    6. the argument we pass through our function call will resolve as the values
    7 & 8. the new keyword creates a new instance of our 'Person' function, with the values we pass into that function when invoking it
